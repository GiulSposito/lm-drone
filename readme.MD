This project implements an ArDrone flight control using LeapMotion.

 - Open Hand: flight ready
 - Hand Inclination: give directions
 - Upping the hand: ArDrone UP
 - Downing the hand: ArDrone Down
 - With one finger, two loops clockwise: TakeOff
 - With one finger, two loops counterclockwise: Land
 
The drone will responde like the inclination of the hand, front finger down the hover will flight to front, as the hand is the body of the drone. 
With the hand open and stray, change the inclination to drive the drone to front/back and left/right.
